I'm in the final year of my PhD at the University of Warwick, where I'm based between the [CDT Urban Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/doctoralstudies/urbanscience/) and the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/). My PhD research is supervised by [Greg McInerny](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/people/greg-mcinerny/) and [João Porto de Albuquerque](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/about-ubdc/who-we-are/team-profiles/directors/joao-porto-de-albuquerque/).

In my PhD work I'm exploring how critical data studies and visualisation can work together in critical visualisation. I’ve been exploring this integration by working with tree data, building age data, and by thinking with seamfulness. 

My research engages with urban data through critical perspectives and practices, with a special focus on how urban data are represented in data visualisation. This is of special relevance for contexts at the intersection of the civic culture and where data analysis and data visualisation increasingly inform decision-making, foster knowledge building, engagement, awareness, literacy and citizens’ agency.

While mostly lying at the intersection of data studies and data visualisation, my research draws from technical, technologically orientated disciplines, in concert with concepts and approaches from geography, philosophy and humanities. This interdisciplinary approach promises to obtain new perspectives that open up conventional concepts and ideas, and address the contemporary challenges deriving from data practices.

Before beginning my PhD at the CDT Urban Science, I did an MA in [Urban Futures](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/studieren/fachbereiche/stadt-bau-kultur/studiengaenge/urbane-zukunft-ma/) from the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. During my studies there I put emphasis on engaging with urban data and data visualisation. As part of my Master's I spend some time as a visiting student at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick. I was taking modules within the MSc Urban Analytics and Visualisation programme as well as working on a meta-analysis that investigates the potential of data visualisation in terms of public participation and engagement.

I did my undergraduate studies in Dutch-German Studies at the University of Münster. This included a year of studying at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where I studied social urban history as well as media and communication.
