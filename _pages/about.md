<font size="7">I'm in the final year of my PhD at the University of Warwick, where I'm based between the [CDT Urban Science](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/doctoralstudies/urbanscience/) and the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/). My PhD research is supervised by [Greg McInerny](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/people/greg-mcinerny/) and [João Porto de Albuquerque](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/about-ubdc/who-we-are/team-profiles/directors/joao-porto-de-albuquerque/). I'm currently writing up my thesis and will be on the job market next spring!

During my PhD I've been exploring how critical data studies and visualisation can work together in critical visualisation. I'm interested in urban-related data and how to represent their limitations, inherent assumptions and definitions with/in visualisation. I’ve been exploring these questions by working with tree data (journal paper out soon!), building age data, and by thinking with [seamfulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02241). 

While mostly lying at the intersection of data studies and data visualisation, my research draws from technical and technologically-orientated disciplines, in concert with concepts and approaches from geography, philosophy and humanities. This interdisciplinary approach promises to obtain fresh perspectives that open up conventional concepts and ideas in data and data visualisation.

Previously, I did an MA in [Urban Futures](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/studieren/fachbereiche/stadt-bau-kultur/studiengaenge/urbane-zukunft-ma/) at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, during which I also spend some time as a visiting student at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick. I took modules within the MSc Urban Analytics and Visualisation programme as well as working on a meta-analysis that investigates the potential of data visualisation in terms of public participation and engagement. I did my undergraduate studies in Dutch-German Studies at the University of Münster, including a year of studies in social urban history as well as media and communication at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</font>
