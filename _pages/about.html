<p>I recently finished my PhD at the University of Warwick, with my thesis titled <i>Developing a practice-based approach to critical visualisation through urban data case studies</i>. I am currently looking for a postdoc position to further explore the intersection of (urban) data studies, visualisation studies and visualisation practices. I am broadly interested in exploring the histories and entanglements of visualisation designs, exploring data-critical visualisation practices and designs, and in exploring the use of visualisation/s as a method and as objects to critically study and engage with the represented phenomenon.</p>
<p>During my PhD studies, I was based between the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/doctoralstudies/urbanscience/" target="_blank">CDT Urban Science</a> and the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/" target="_blank">Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies</a>. My PhD research was supervised by <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/people/greg-mcinerny/" target="_blank">Greg McInerny</a> and <a href="https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/about-ubdc/who-we-are/team-profiles/directors/joao-porto-de-albuquerque/" target="_blank">Jo&atilde;o Porto de Albuquerque</a>.</p>
<p>In my PhD research, I explored how critical data studies and visualisation can work together in critical visualisation. I'm interested in how data represent what they represent, how they are represented and made explorable in visualisation/s, and how their limitations, inherent assumptions and definitions can be represented with/in visualisation. I explored these questions by working with <a href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/idj.22006.hen">tree data</a>, building age data, and through exploring how <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02241">seamful visualisation</a>‚Äîas a critical lens, method, and practice‚Äîcould facilitate a critical approach to visualisation by surfacing and representing the seams hidden in seamless visualisations. üå≥ üè† ü™°</p>
<p>While mostly lying at the intersection of data studies and data visualisation, my research is interdisciplinary and draws from technical and technologically-orientated disciplines, together with concepts and approaches from philosophy and humanities.</p>
<p>Prior to my PhD, I did an MA in <a href="https://www.fh-potsdam.de/studieren/fachbereiche/stadt-bau-kultur/studiengaenge/urbane-zukunft-ma/" target="_blank">Urban Futures</a> at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, during which I spend some time as a visiting student at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick where I studied within the MSc Urban Analytics and Visualisation programme. I did my undergraduate studies in <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/ZNS/studium/bachelor/index.shtml">Dutch-German Studies</a> at the University of M&uuml;nster, including a year of studies in social urban history as well as media and communication at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>
